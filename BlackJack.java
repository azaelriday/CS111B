/* Algorithm:
 *     1. Draw two cards to both player and dealer
 *     2. Both player's cards are print out but only one is for the dealer
 *        ┌───────────────┐
 *        |               ↓
 *        | i. Check if the player has not busted yet and want to draw a card
 *        |   if so:
 *        |      a. Draw a card for the player
 *        |      b. Calculate and print out the running total for player
 *        |      c. Check player's point for game status
 *        |        if game has finished:
 *        |          A. Print result
 *        |        if not:
 *        |          A. Check player's intention on keep hitting
 *        |          B. Update game status
 *        └───────────────┘
 *        ┌───────────────┐
 *        |               ↓
 *        | i. Check game status and if dealer's point have not hit 17
 *        |   if so:
 *        |      a. Draw a card for the dealer
 *        |      b. Calculate and print out the running total for dealer
 *        |      c. Check dealer's point for game status
 *        |        if game has finished:
 *        |          A. Print result
 *        └───────────────┘
 *     Check game status (has the game over?)
 *       if so:
 *         a. Compare player & dealer's points
 *         b. Determine the final result
